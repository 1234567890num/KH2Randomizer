## 1

### 1AW/100AW

Common abbreviations for 100 Acre Wood.

### 1K

Common short name referring to the 1,000 Heartless fight.

## A

### ABN

A common abbreviation for [All Blue Numbers](../overview/index.md#all-blue-numbers-abn), a win condition where all
worlds need to have a blue number next to them in the item tracker to consider the win condition met.

### AG

A common abbreviation for Agrabah.

### AS

A common abbreviation for Absent Silhouette.

### AT

A common abbreviation for Atlantica.

### AX1

A common abbreviation for the first fight against Armored Xemnas.

### AX2

A common abbreviation for the second fight against Armored Xemnas.

## B

### BC

A common abbreviation for Beast's Castle.

## C

### Car Key

A nickname for the Fenrir keyblade, due to its appearance.

### Check

A location in the game where you can receive a randomized reward. Can also refer to the randomized rewards themselves.
It is usually clear from context which is meant.

### CoR

A common abbreviation for the Cavern of Remembrance.

### CoR Skip

A technique where the player clips out-of-bounds in the Cavern of Remembrance in order to bypass the difficult fights in
this area. The downside of this skip is that one treasure chest is left largely unobtainable due to an invisible wall
that does not get removed when the skip is performed.

## D

### DC

A common abbreviation for Disney Castle.

### Desperation Move

An "ultimate" attack performed by an enemy (usually a boss) where the enemy is usually invincible for the duration of
the move. Often the screen dims during such an attack.

### DM

A common abbreviation for [Desperation Move](#desperation-move).

### Dome Skip

A technique where the player can skip Final Xemnas's "laser dome" [desperation move](#desperation-move). If you're able
to deplete all of his health before he has a chance to start the laser dome move, the fight ends (in contrast to the
normal game where the laser dome is unskippable).

This technique works on both normal Final Xemnas and Data Final Xemnas.

Successfully skipping the laser dome saves roughly 90 seconds of cutscene time, so it is a technique that most
randomizer players will try to accomplish, especially in a race. If a player fails to skip the laser dome, it's often
referred to as "getting domed".

## E

### Early Throne Room

A common phrase synonymous with [Shan-Yu Skip](#shan-yu-skip).

## G

### Garden of Assemblage

The area of the game where there are 13 portals that normally lead to battles with the Data Organization XIII. In
randomizer, the area is repurposed to be the world hub, where each portal leads to a specific world.

### Go Mode

The point in a randomizer game where the player has all required items for the win condition, but still needs to
complete one or more final tasks (usually referring to defeating Final Xemnas).

### GoA

A common abbreviation for [Garden of Assemblage](#garden-of-assemblage).

## H

### HB

A common abbreviation for Hollow Bastion.

### Hint

A way of giving the player information about some of the randomized rewards in a randomizer game.
See [Hint Systems](../hints/index.md).

### Hinted Hint

See [What are "hinted hints"? Why do they matter?](../hints/index.md#what-are-hinted-hints-why-do-they-matter)

### Hitlist

A win condition for the randomizer that requires the player fulfill certain objectives. See
[Hitlist](../overview/index.md#hitlist) for more.

### HT

A common abbreviation for Halloween Town.

## I

### IC

A common abbreviation for [Important Check](#important-check).

### Important Check

A randomized reward agreed upon to be considered "important" (usually in terms of one of the
[hint systems](../hints/index.md)).

## J

### Jail

A nickname given to [Simulated Twilight Town](#simulated-twilight-town). Early on in the randomizer's development, the
player could not leave STT until close to the end of the world, so choosing to go there was dubbed "going to jail".

Even though the randomizer has been updated to allow the player to leave much earlier in the world, STT is often sill
referred to as Jail.

## L

### LoD

A common abbreviation for Land of Dragons.

### LW

A common abbreviation for Lingering Will.

## M

### Map Crash

On the PC Epic Games Store version of the game, the game sometimes crashes when choosing a location on the map
(commonly known as "map crash"). It is recommended to save anytime you're about to talk to Jack on the ship to choose a
destination.

As of release 2.1, the randomizer seed generator has a "Remove Port Royal Map Select" option that, when enabled,
replaces the map location selection screen with simple text options, hopefully preventing the crash altogether.

## O

### OC

A common abbreviation for Olympus Coliseum.

### OM

A common abbreviation for the Once More ability.

### OpenKH Mods Manager

A program from the OpenKH project that can apply modifications to an extracted version of the KH2 game.

This works for both the PCSX2 emulated version of the game as well as the PC Epic Games Store version.

## P

### PL

A common abbreviation for Pride Lands.

### PR

A common abbreviation for Port Royal.

### Promise Charm

An item that, if enabled for a randomized game, can open an alternate path to the final boss fights. Once the Promise
Charm and all 3 Proofs are obtained, interacting with the computer in the Garden of Assemblage leads to the alternate
path. This alternate path includes several Bulky Vendor enemies that give large amounts of experience.

### Proof

One of three items normally given as rewards for defeating difficult challenges.

* The Proof of Connection is normally given as a reward for defeating the Lingering Will. In randomizer, once obtained,
  this item _unlocks_ the Lingering Will fight.
* The Proof of Peace is normally given as a reward for appeasing all of Mushroom XIII. In randomizer, once obtained,
  this item allows you to interact with the mushrooms in Hollow Bastion / Radiant Garden to receive two randomized
  rewards.
* The Proof of Nonexistence is normally given as a reward for defeating all of Data Organization XIII. Obtaining this
  item in randomizer has no specific effect.

In randomizer, these three items, collectively, unlock the door at the Altar of Naught that leads to the final boss
fights.

### Push The Mouse

A technique used when escorting Minnie across the Colonnade where the player attempts to push Minnie along the wall
rather than using the Call Over reaction command. If done well, this can save time.

## R

### RC

A common abbreviation for Reaction Command.

### Revenge Value

A hidden meter that bosses and enemies have that determines when they will retaliate after being attacked. This prevents
the player from being able to infinitely stun-locking the enemy (in most cases, though there are several exceptions).

Strategies for defeating bosses quickly or consistently often involve manipulating the revenge value to force the boss
to retaliate at opportune moments.

### RV

A common abbreviation for [Revenge Value](#revenge-value).

## S

### Save Warp

Leaving a world at a Save Point and re-entering the world knowing that the game will place you at the next save point.
See [Save Warping](../overview/index.md#save-warping).

### SC

A common abbreviation for the Second Chance ability.

### Seed

A specific playthrough of the randomizer game.

The terminology comes from a computer's random number generator. When given a certain input, the random number generator
will always produce the same output. The input given to a random number generator is known as a "seed".

In KH2 randomizer, the input to the random number generator is comprised of

* the version of the seed generator
* the seed name
* all of the seed settings (other than cosmetic ones)

If the input to the random number generator is the same, then all of the randomizations performed to the game should be
the same. If the input changes at all (such as the seed name or even _one_ of the seed settings changing), then the
randomizations will be completely different.

### Seed Hash

A sequence of images generated and stored along with the seed.

![Seed Hash example](../seed-generator/seed-hash.png)

The seed hash is displayed several places.

* The seed generator itself
* OpenKH Mods Manager
* The item tracker
* The New Game screen in the game itself

The hash can be used for multiple purposes.

* Ensuring the seed you're about to start matches the one you have loaded into the tracker
* Ensuring all players in a race or co-op format have the same seed
    * It's common to post a screenshot of the seed hash before a race starts for all racers to compare against

### Shan-Yu Skip

A technique where the player jumps over the cutscene trigger that begins the Shan-Yu fight in Land of Dragons in order
to (at least temporarily) bypass the fight. This allows the player to acquire the many treasure chests in the Throne
Room far earlier than intended.

Once the treasure chests are obtained, the player can either leave via the Save Point in the Throne Room, or can go back
outside and trigger the cutscene to fight Shan-Yu, progressing the story as normal.

### Shotgunning

A common technique used early in a randomizer game that involves entering many worlds in quick succession, only picking
up treasure chests that are easily accessible without dealing with much difficult combat.

Can also refer to entering a single world, picking up the easy chests, and leaving.

### Simulated Twilight Town

Refers to the digital Twilight Town in which the player controls Roxas.

### Sora's Heart

A term used as a synonym for Sora's level-up rewards in the item tracker. For example, "Sora's heart has 2 important
checks" means that two [important checks](#important-check) are contained within Sora's level-up rewards.

### SP

A common abbreviation for Space Paranoids.

### STT

A common abbreviation for [Simulated Twilight Town](#simulated-twilight-town).

## T

### Throne Room Skip

A common synonym for [Shan-Yu Skip](#shan-yu-skip).

### Tifa's Chest

A nickname given to the treasure chest in the Heartless Manufactory area of Hollow Bastion / Radiant Garden, due to Tifa
being present in this room at one point in the game.

### TR

A common abbreviation for Timeless River.

### TT

A common abbreviation for Twilight Town.

### TWTNW

A common abbreviation for The World That Never Was.

## V

### Visit Unlock

Second visits to many worlds are "locked" by the Garden of Assemblage mod utilized by the randomizer. In order to unlock
the second visits, you will need to obtain certain "visit unlock" items.

A table of which visits are unlocked by which items is below.

![Visit Unlock Table](../seed-generator/locks.png)

> Quick Tip: To make sure the game can update story flags when you collect a visit unlock, you need to trigger a
> cutscene or enter The World that Never Was. That will update the game, and you can continue to the next visit.

## W

### Wavedashing

A term, borrowed from _Super Smash Bros._, commonly used to describe Roxas's movement when using the Quick Run ability.
Since Roxas's character model was not programmed with an animation for Quick Run, he soft of hops along the ground and
this has been dubbed "wavedashing".

As of release 2.1, the randomizer seed generator has a "Roxas Magic/Movement/Trinity" option that ports Sora's movement
animations to Roxas, therefore allowing Roxas to Quick Run properly.

## Y

### Yeet the Bear

Refers to The Hunny Pot minigame in 100 Acre Wood - Starry Hill, where Sora removes the hunny pot from Pooh's head.
Though in reality it's the pot that goes flying, this is still often referred to as "yeeting the bear".

Can also refer to a setting in the seed generator that places the Proof of Nonexistence as a reward for "yeeting the
bear". This setting effectively forces the player to find all Torn Pages as well as the two other Proof items in order
to unlock the door to final fights.

## Z

### Zebraman

A nickname for Final Xemnas, due to his attire resembling a zebra.
