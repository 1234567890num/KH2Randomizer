# Hint Systems

The randomizer community has come up with three different hint systems, summarized here.

### JSmartee

When you find an Ansem Report in-game, you are told how many Important Checks exist in a
world. [Learn more](jsmartee/index.md)

### Shananas

You are informed once you have found all Important Checks in a world. [Learn more](shananas/index.md)

### Points

A mix of the Shananas and JSmartee hint systems where Important Checks are given point
values. [Learn more](points/index.md)

## How do I use hints?

When choosing options for generating a seed, choose which hint system to use on the Hints tab. Once generated, your seed
zip file can be loaded into the [Item Tracker](https://github.com/Dee-Ayy/KH2Tracker) either by dragging the zip file
onto the tracker window, or by choosing `Options > Hint Mode > Load OpenKH Seed` and browsing to the seed zip file.
