# Shananas Hints

Once your seed is loaded into the tracker, each location will start with a zero indicating you have not obtained any
Important Checks from any of the locations.

Any worlds that indicated as complete (with default settings, completion is indicated using a blue number) means there
are no Important Checks there.

![Empty Tracker](shananas_tracker_empty.png)

In the screenshot above, we know Disney Castle has no Important Checks (though there still may be useful items/tools
there).

As you find Important Checks in the game, the numbers for each location will track the number of Important Checks found
there. Once the tracker indicates a world is complete, all Important Checks there have been found.

![Tracker with Items](shananas_tracker_some_items.png)

In the screenshot above, 3 Important Checks were found in Olympus Coliseum and the world is now indicated complete,
meaning no more Important Checks are located there (though there still may be useful items/tools there). Additionally, 3
Important Checks were found in Beast's Castle, and since the world is not indicated complete, Beast's Castle must
contain at least one more Important Check.
