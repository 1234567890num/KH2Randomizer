# Shananas Hints

In the Shananas hint system, there are 37 items in the game designated as Important Checks.

* 3 levels of each of the 6 Magic spells (18 total)
* 5 Drive Forms
* Once More
* Second Chance
* 5 Torn Pages
* 4 Summons
* 3 Proofs

If the Promise Charm is enabled for the seed, it is also considered an Important Check, bringing the total to 38.

Once your seed is loaded into the tracker, each location will start with a zero indicating you have not obtained any
Important Checks from any of the locations. Any location with a blue zero means there are no Important Checks there.

As you find Important Checks in the game, the numbers for each location will track the number of Important Checks found
there. Once the number for a location turns blue, all Important Checks there have been found.

In the screenshot above, 3 Important Checks were found in Olympus Coliseum and the number is now blue, meaning no more
Important Checks are located there (though there still may be useful items/tools there). Additionally, 4 Important
Checks were found in Twilight Town, and since the number is still yellow, Twilight Town must contain at least one more
Important Check.
