## 8/29 update
- PC Support is here through the build_from_mm bridge program. See [here](https://github.com/tommadness/KH2Randomizer/blob/master/helpinfo/pc.md) for instructions.
- Random Music (PC Only)! Can include music from KH2, BBS, and Recom (if including BBS/Recom music those games need to be extracted, as noted [here](https://github.com/tommadness/KH2Randomizer/blob/master/helpinfo/pc.md))
- Daily seeds! Once a day seeds with different settings each day. see [here](https://github.com/tommadness/KH2Randomizer/blob/master/helpinfo/dailyseeds.md) for details.
- Logic validator to guarantee every location can be reached. There is also now a new seed modifier (on by default) which allows any item to be in any location, see [here](https://pastebin.com/mNhYP9DV) for details.
- Seed difficulty setting, to change how likely an important item is to be found early or late. From "super easy" to "insane". See [here](https://pastebin.com/mNhYP9DV) for details.
- Seed modifier to start Sora/Donald/Goofy with 0 AP.
- Fixed a bug causing the non-critical difficulty modes to start without starting inventory or the proper amount of AP.
- Fixed a bug preventing the "Remove Damage Cap" seed modifier from being used without also enabling random bosses/enemies.
