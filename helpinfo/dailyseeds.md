## Daily Seeds

A daily seed is a set seed that is automatically generated each day, using a number of randomly generated modifiers to the default ruleset.

Note that PC and PS2 times can't be directly compared, as the enemy/boss randomizations will be completely different (but the item locations will be the same)

The default ruleset:
- 3x Sora XP, levels to 50
- Form XP: 5x Valor, 3x Wisdom, 3x Limit, 2x Master, 3x Final
- Keyblade stats 0-7
- No promise charm
- JSmartee Hints
- Max Logic Item Placement
- All locations except Terra/Datas/Atlantica/Cups
- Normal Item Placement Difficulty
- Enemy/Boss Randomization set to One to One with scaled health

Each day 3 modifiers are randomly picked from the below list, to change the default ruleset (on Fri-Sun 5 modifiers are picked instead)

- Level it up: Level 99 but Sora XP multiplier set to 10x
- No Levels: No checks on Levels and you start with No Experience
- Promise Charm: Start the game with the Promise Charm
- Go Mode: Start the game with all 3 proofs
- Action Keyblades: Keyblades can have action or support abilities
- Wild Bosses: Bosses are randomized using the Wild setting
- Superbosses: All superbosses will be included in the randomization pool, and their reward locations are added to the item pool, but your XP is at least times 5
- X-Ray Vision: Sora
- Shananas Hints: Use Shananas hints
- Glass Cannon: Replaces all defense ups found during level ups
- Library of Assemblage: Start the game with every Ansem Report
- Schmovement: Start the game with level 1 of each movement type
- Better Junk: Replaces all synthesis materials with better items
- Randomize Ability Pool: Pick Sora's Action/Support abilities at random (Guaranteed 1 SC & 1 OM)
- Have Some Finny Fun: Atlantica is turned on.
- Remove Damage Cap: Remove the damage cap for Sora dealing damage to enemies
- More Powerful keyblades: Keyblades can have maximum stats of up to 20
- Early Checks: Worlds are more likely to have better checks early, than late
- Late Checks: Worlds are more likely to have better checks early, than late
- No Starting AP: Sora/Donald/Goofy start the game with 0 AP

In the 2Fm Rando discord you can find both spoiler and non spoiler channels to compare times and discuss the ruleset/modifiers for daily seeds.
