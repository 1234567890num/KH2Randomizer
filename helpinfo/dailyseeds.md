## Daily Seeds

A daily seed is a set seed that is automatically generated each day, using a number of randomly generated modifiers to the default ruleset.

Note that PC and PS2 times can't be directly compared, as the enemy/boss randomizations will be completely different (but the item locations will be the same)

The default ruleset:
- 3x Sora XP, levels to 50
- Form XP: 5x Valor, 3x Wisdom, 3x Limit, 2x Master, 3x Final
- Keyblade stats 0-7
- No promise charm
- JSmartee Hints
- Max Logic Item Placement
- All locations except Terra/Datas/Atlantica/Cups
- Normal Item Placement Difficulty
- Enemy Randomization set to One to One

Each day 3 modifiers are randomly picked from the below list, to change the default ruleset (on Fri-Sun 5 modifiers are picked instead)

- Level it up: Level 99 but Sora XP multiplier set to 10x
- No Levels: No checks on Levels and you start with No Experience
- Promise Charm: Start the game with the Promise Charm
- Go Mode: Start the game with all 3 proofs
- Action Keyblades: Keyblades can have action or support abilities
- Wild Bosses: Bosses are randomized using the Wild setting
- Superbosses: All superbosses will be included in the randomization pool, and their reward locations are added to the item pool, but your XP is at least times 5
- X-Ray Vision: Sora
- Shananas Hints: Use Shananas hints
- Glass Cannon: Replaces all defense ups found during level ups
- Library of Assemblage: Start the game with every Ansem Report
- Schmovement: Start the game with level 1 of each movement type
- Better Junk: Replaces all synthesis materials with better items
- Randomize Ability Pool: Pick Sora's Action/Support abilities at random (Guaranteed 1 SC & 1 OM)
- Have Some Finny Fun: Atlantica is turned on.
- Remove Damage Cap: Remove the damage cap for Sora dealing damage to enemies
- More Powerful keyblades: Keyblades can have maximum stats of up to 20
- Early Checks: Worlds are more likely to have better checks early, than late
- No Starting AP: Sora/Donald/Goofy start the game with 0 AP
- Statsanity: Stat boosts are added into the pool of randomized checks
- One to One Bosses: Bosses are randomized using the One to One setting
- Vanilla Enemies: Enemies are vanilla
- Cups Give XP: Olympus cups are ON, but you start with Hades Cup and you will gain XP and Form XP in the cups
- Stay out of Twilight Town: Twilight Town and Simulated Twilight Town are both turned off
- Shut Out of Worlds: 4 random worlds (the daily seed will tell you which) will have no good checks. HB and COR are combined into one world for this modifier.

In the 2Fm Rando discord you can find both spoiler and non spoiler channels to compare times and discuss the ruleset/modifiers for daily seeds.
