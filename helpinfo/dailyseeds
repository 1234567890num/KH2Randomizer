- daily seeds are seeds that have different modifiers which change automatically each day.

- the default settings are
leagueish
enemy/boss one to one
sora xp - 3

pc and ps2 times can't be directly compared, the seed hash and treasure placements will be identical but the enemy/boss randomizations will be different (on pc it can be better)

there are spoiler and non spoiler channels in the 2FM rando discord to compare times and discuss the settings/modifiers/anything daily related
