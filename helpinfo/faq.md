## What does Max Logic Item Placement do?
**Max Logic Item Placement** is a seed modifier that makes all items obtainable, removing most "hard" restrictions on locations.

Guarantees:
- At least 1 `Fire Element`, 1 `Blizzard Element`, and 1 `Thunder Element` before Agrabah 2
- At least 3 `High Jump`s, `Quick Run`s, `Aerial Dodge`s, and `Glide`s before Cavern of Remembrance

Common "Unusual" Occurances from standard item placement logic:
- `Torn Pages` on Form Levels
- Form on Forms
- `Torn Pages` in 100 Acre Wood after Pooh's Howse
- `Blizzard Element` in Agrabah 2
- `Torn Pages` or a form on Mushroom 13

## What does Randomize Ability Pool do?
By default, the ability pool is set. There are always 3 `Finishing Plus` abilities, 2 `Scan`s, 1 `Light & Darkness`, et cetera.

**Randomize Ability Pool** makes it so the only guarantee is exactly 1 `Second Chance` and 1 `Once More` in the ability pool. This can result in, for example, 2 `Finishing Plus`es, 0 `Scan`s, 3 `Light & Darkness`es, et cetera.

## What does Seed Item Placement Difficulty mean?
**Seed Item Placement Difficulty** weights "favorable" checks earlier or later in a world, depending on the setting.

Items that are weighted include:
 
- Proofs
- Magic
- Forms
- Summons
- Torn Pages
- Second Chance/Once More
- Promise Charm
- Munny Pouches
 
Abilities that are weighted (when off keyblades) include:
 
- Combo Master
- Finishing Plus
- Negative Combo
- Experience Boost
- Light & Darkness
- Horizontal Slash
- Slide Dash
- Flash Step
- Guard Break
- Explosion
- Aerial Dive
- Magnet Burst
- Trinity Limit

## What is the "Nightmare" Item Placement Difficulty?

Nightmare difficulty is an extra difficult item placement setting that expands the pool of items that are pushed late in a seed, as well as changing the weighting for locked areas that you can get checks from (e.g. forms and 100 acre). The expanded pool of items is:

- Combo Boost
- Air Combo Boost
- Berserk Charge
- Form Boost
- Draw
- Drive Converter
- Auto Forms

Additionally, **puzzle rewards are guaranteed randomized in this setting, and likely to have important checks**, and those checks, while they are unhinted, may still be required to unlock other checks you need to finish the seed.
