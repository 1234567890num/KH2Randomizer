If configuring music rando to work with more than kh2, you must create extracted folders for the games you want to include (bbs and recom supported)

The simplest
You can do this by opening the pc-modsmanager-bridge program, and selecting "bbs" or "recom", and then running the "extract" option

Assuming you already extracted KH2PC with this method, it should work fine.

If you end up with some file not found errors when doing "build only" you likely didn't extract the games to the right spot.
